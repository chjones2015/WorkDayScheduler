# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The Workday Scheduler is a web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that allows users to plan their workday by creating a schedule for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm. The user is presented with time blocks for each hour of the workday, and each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future. The user can enter an event for each time block and save it to local storage by clicking the save button. The saved events persist even after the page is refreshed. With the Workday Scheduler, users can easily keep track of their daily tasks and stay organized.
